# Health Self-Hosting Starter

This repository is a clean slate for building a self-hosted health application. It ships with a minimal static site so you can begin designing product copy, flows, and components without legacy baggage.

## What's Included
- **Lean landing page** (`index.html`) that explains the self-hosting concept.
- **Modern styling** (`styles.css`) with CSS variables for quick theme tweaks.
- **Progressive enhancements** (`script.js`) for accessibility and a touch of interaction.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository and install a simple static server (e.g., `npm install -g serve`).
2. From the project root, run `serve .` (or open `index.html` directly in your browser).
3. Start iterating on content and components for your health self-hosting experience.

## Customization Ideas
- Replace the placeholder copy with your product messaging.
- Add sections for onboarding flows, data import/export, and privacy controls.
- Hook the UI into your preferred backend or static site generator when ready.
