            <h2 class="section-title">About</h2>
            <div class="about-content">
                <p>I'm Sebastian, a 20-year-old audio and video specialist from Saffron Walden. I've spent the past 8 years immersed in professional audio engineering and video production, learning through hundreds of hours of hands-on work and real-world projects that actually shipped.</p>

                <p>My main focus is audio mastering and video editing. I've worked remotely for 4+ years, delivering broadcast-quality content and meeting deadlines reliably every week. Beyond the creative work, I genuinely enjoy the technical side—I've built network storage systems, deployed AI models with PyTorch and TensorFlow, and provided IT solutions for corporate clients. I'm comfortable across Windows, macOS, and Linux, which comes in handy more often than you'd think.</p>

                <p>As an ENFP, I naturally gravitate toward work that blends creativity with problem-solving. I work independently, communicate clearly, and genuinely care about delivering quality results. Whether it's mastering a vocal track in Logic Pro X, colour grading a multi-camera edit, or troubleshooting a complex network issue, I approach each project with the same attention to detail and commitment to getting it right.</p>
